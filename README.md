## System Architecture

### Data Flow
```
HR Adds Employee ‚Üí Data Saved ‚Üí Employee Credentials Created ‚Üí Employee Can Login ‚Üí View Personal Data
```

### Data Storage
- **Current**: localStorage (for demonstration)
- **Production**: Can be easily replaced with backend API calls
- **Data Structure**: Comprehensive employee objects with all necessary information

### Authentication
- **HR Access**: Direct access to admin dashboard
- **Employee Access**: Login required with HR-provided credentials
- **Session Management**: Automatic session handling and logout

## Configuration

### Employee Types
- **Worker**: Full information required (children, references, unit, line)
- **Staff**: Basic information only (no children, references, unit, line)

### Salary Calculations
- **Worker Formula**: `Basic Salary = (Gross Salary - 2450) / 1.5`
- **Staff Formula**: `Basic Salary = Gross Salary √ó 0.45`

### Default Values
- **Leave Balance**: Casual (12), Sick (7), Annual (15), Maternity (0), Earned (8)
- **Default Password**: `password123` for all employees

## Customization

### Adding New Fields
1. Update the `formData` state in `AddEmployee.jsx`
2. Add corresponding form inputs
3. Update the preview component
4. Modify the employee service to handle new data

### Changing Salary Formulas
1. Update the `calculateWorkerSalary` and `calculateStaffSalary` functions
2. Modify the salary components structure if needed

### Styling Changes
- The system uses Tailwind CSS for styling
- Modify component classes to change appearance
- Update color schemes and layouts as needed

## Security Considerations

### Current Implementation
- Basic authentication using localStorage
- No encryption of sensitive data
- Suitable for demonstration and development

### Production Recommendations
- Implement proper backend authentication
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Encrypt sensitive employee data
- Implement role-based access control
- Add audit logging for all operations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Employee Can't Login
- Verify Employee ID format (EMP001, EMP002, etc.)
- Check if password is correct (default: `password123`)
- Ensure employee was properly added by HR

#### Data Not Saving

- Verify localStorage is enabled
- Check if employee service is properly imported

#### Preview Not Working
